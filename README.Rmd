### Overview of contents

This repository is our research compendium for our analysis of the haul-out behavior and detectability of bearded, ribbon, and spotted seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas. We intend for this compendium to containa all data, code, and text associated with the publication. The `R` files in the `analysis/` directory contain details of how all the analyses reported in the paper were conducted. The `data/` directory contains all the R data objects and `data-raw/` contains original data files or database exports. The `manuscript/` diretory currently contains the _*.docs* versions of the manuscript. 

### The R package 

This repository is organized as an R package. There are no actual R functions in this package - all the R code is in the Rmd file. We simply used the R package structure to help manage dependencies, to take advantage of organizational and build features.
